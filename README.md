## GMD2SCRATCH
### A tool that allows you to import real GD levels into [my GD scratch port](https://turbowarp.org/1136801417/fullscreen).
You will need the GDShare mod in Geode to use this. First, get the .gmd file of the level you wanna import via the mod (using a level from update 1.0 is heavily recommended) then upload it to this site to get the save code:
